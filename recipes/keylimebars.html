    <h1>Key Lime Bars</h1>

    <p>
        A key lime bar balances a tart and creamy topping with a buttery rich base. For the base, we wanted something 
        similar to shortbread: a crisp, buttery crust that could support the topping and yet slice neatly and easily.

                Adjust oven rack to middle position and 
                heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling 
                for 8-inch square bakig pan by folding 2 
                long sheets of aluminum foil so each is 8 
                inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan 
                perpendicular to each other, with extra 
                foil hanging over edges. Push foil into 
                corners and up sides of pa, smoothing foil 
                flush to pan; spray with vegetable oil.

                paddle, mix flour blend, sugar, salt, and 
                xanthan gum to low speed until combined. Add 
                butter, 1 piece at a time, conntiue to mix 
                until dough forms and pulls away from sides 
                of bowl, 2 to 3 miutes. (Add 1 to 2 tablespoons 
                of water as eneded if dough appears dry.)
