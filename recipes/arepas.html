        Arepas are a type of corn cake popular in Venezuela and Columbia, 
        though iterations exist in other Latin countries. The Venezuelan 
        variety is served as sandwiches that are split open and stuffed 
        with anything from meat and cheese to corn, beans, or even fish. 
        The arepa itself is made using masarepa (naturally 
        gluten-free corn flour) along with water ad salt.

    <h3><u>Ingredients</u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>10 ounces (2 cups) masarepa blanca </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups warm water </li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil </li>

      </ul>
 
    <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Adjust oven rack to middle position
                and heat oven to 400 degrees. Whisk 
                masarepa, salt, and bakig powder 
                together in bowl. Gradually add water
                and stir until combined. Using generous
                1/3 cup dough, form eight 3-inch rounds, 
                each about 1/3 inch thick. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch non-
                stick skillet over medium-high heat until
                shimmering. Add 4 arepas and cook until
                golden on both sides, about 4 minutes per
                side. Transfer to wire rack set in rimmed
                baking sheet and repeat with remaining 2
                tablespoons oil and remaining 4 arepas.
                (Fried arepas can be refrigerated for up
                to 3 days, or frozen for up to 1 month.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake util arepas sound hollow when tapped
                on bottom, about 10 minutes. (If frozen,
                do not thaw before bakig; increase baking
                time by 20 minutes.) Split hot arepas open
                using paring knife or two forks, and stuff
                each with geerous 3 tablespoons of filling.
                Serve immediately.
