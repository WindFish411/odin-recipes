                over low heat for at least 10 minutes. While 
                skillet is heating, whisk flour blend, 1 1/2 
                teaspoons sugar, and salt together in medium bowl.

                until incorporated. Whisk in remaining milk 
                mixture until smooth.

            <li>
                Using paper towel, wipe out skillet, leaving thin 
                film of oil on bottom ad sides of pan. Increase heat 
                to medium and let skillet heat for 1 minute. After 
                1 minute, test heat of skillet by placig 1 teaspoon 
                batter in center and cook for 20 seconds. If mini 
                test crêpe is golden brown on bottom, skillet is 
                properly heated; if too light or too dark, adjust 
                heat accordingly and retest.
